### Key Code Features

```python
# Example of verification system I implemented
def verify_task(self, task_id: int) -> None:
    """Handles the complete verification workflow"""
    with self.create_connection() as conn:
        task = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id=?", (task_id,)).fetchone()
    
    # Verification UI components
    with st.expander(f"üîç Verify Task: {task['title']}", expanded=True):
        verification_status = st.selectbox("Outcome", ["Approved", "Needs Revision", "Rejected"])
        verification_comments = st.text_area("Comments")
        
        if st.button("Submit Verification"):
            self._update_verification_status(
                task_id,
                verification_status,
                verification_comments
            )
